# COVID-19 Patient Classifier (WIP)

Welcome to the repository for the COVID-19 Patient Classifier, a deep learning project aimed at developing an accurate and efficient model to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative cases. The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and medical imaging data to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of COVID-19.

### ðŸš§ Project Status: Work in Progress ðŸš§

This repository is actively under development. I am currently working on refining the model architecture, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation metrics to ensure robustness and reliability. Contributions, suggestions, and constructive feedback are highly welcome!

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
